# Relaxed Dark
**A relaxing dark theme to make your daily computer usage pleasant for your eyes**

**Please read:** This theme is in development. I have been looking for a dark theme I can use as my daily driver. I know there are a lot of themes out there, but I also wanted to learn how to create my own theme for the apps I use. This is the main reason for "Relaxed Dark".

Most of the theme are not released on any store/extension pages. The ones that are, can be found linked below.

- [MS Marketplace: Visual Studio Code Theme Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TobiasDev.relaxed-dark)
- [Open VSX: VS Codium Theme Extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/TobiasDev/relaxed-dark)

## Finished / To-be done
_I started working on a Solarized version of the "Relaxed Dark" since I noticed that the theme was a bit too dark. Since I always been a fan of the solarized theme, but didn't love it, I decided to make my own concept._

**The original Relaxed Dark will NOT be deleted**
