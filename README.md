# Relaxed Dark
A relaxing dark theme to make your daily computer usage pleasant for your eyes

**Please read:** This theme is still in very early stages. I have been looking for a relaxing dark theme I can use in my daily computer usage. I know there are a lot of themes out there, but I also wanted to learn how to create my own theme for the apps I use daily. This is the main reason for "Relaxed Dark". 

This theme is not yet release on any store-pages. I will release this theme once I get further in the development with it.

## To-be themed
